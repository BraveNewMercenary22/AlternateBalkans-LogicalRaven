# AlternateBalkans-LogicalRaven
Alternate Balkans is a new Hearts of Iron 4 mod created for the 1.5.2 Cornflakes update that takes place in an Alternate Historical Balkans where several crucial events including the First and Second Balkan Wars, the First World War, and subsequent and former treaties ended differently than they did in our timeline affording more power to certain states and allowing others to retain independence in a world where they might otherwise end up under foreign or collective rule. In this timeline Balkan countries have retain some power, most notably Bulgaria and Croatia. Other countries exist that never existed in our timeline as well such as the Communist Revolutionary Bessarabia, a more powerful post-Great War Austria, and a Hungarian Slovakian Kingdom titled "Magyar-Slovakia". No matter what country you choose to play as, there should be plenty to do and we hope you have as much fun playing this mod as we had creating it.
